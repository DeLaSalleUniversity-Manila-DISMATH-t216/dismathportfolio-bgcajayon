## Week 1
##### This week we were introduced to the basics of dismath

* Propositions - declarative sentence. EITHER true or false

* Propositional Variables - denoted by letters

* Operators - Explains the interaction between Propositional Variables
  * 1.NEGATION: Usage NOT
  * 2.Conjunction: Usage AND
  * 3.DISJUNCTION: Usage OR
  * 4.EXCLUSIVE OR: Usage XOR
  * 5.CONDITIONAL: Usage IF,THEN
  * 6.BICONDITIONAL: Usage IFF
  
* Logical connectives - a set of propositions and operators which are assumed to be equivalent.

* Truth Table - A table for truth values for logical connectives

* Truth Value - Value of propositions

* Compound Propositions - Created from existing propositions using logical operators. 



## Week 2
##### This week we started going deep in dismath, AND IT IS VERY CONFUSING but deceptively entertaining.
  
##### Propositional equivalences  ( Apparently i can't or i just don't know how to input special characters)
* Testing for equivalence the only way we have so far to prove that two propositions are equivalent is a truth table.

* Logical Equivalences - these are laws that have already been proven.
  * 1. IDENTITY LAWS
  * 2. DOMINATION LAWS
  * 3. DOUBLE NEGATION LAWS
  * 4. COMMUTATIVE LAWS
  * 5. ASSOCIATIVE LAWS
  * 6. DISTRIBUTIVE LAWS
  * 7. DE MORGAN'S LAWS
  * 8. ABSORPTION LAWS
  * 9. NEGATION LAWS

## Week 3

##### This week we started seeing life in a very different way we're not sure if superman does exist or not.


* RULES OF INFERENCE - Establishes the validity of some relatively simple argument forms

  * 1. MODUS PONENS
  * 2. MODUS TOLLENS
  * 3. HYPOTHETICAL SYLLOGISM
  * 4. DISJUNCTIVE SYLLOGISM
  * 5. ADDITION
  * 6. SIMPLIFICATION
  * 7. CONJUNCTION
  * 8. Resolution

## Week 4

##### This week we started proving algebraic equations

##### METHODS OF PROOF
1. Direct Proof
2. Proof by Contraposition
3. Vacuous Proof
4. Trivial Proof
5. Proof by Contradiction
